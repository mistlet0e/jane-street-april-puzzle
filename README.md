# Jane Street April Puzzle Challenge
This python code was used to solve the math puzzle from Jane Street in Mar 2022. The problem basically requires you to find out a solution that fits into the given graph. It consists of four interconnected 'almost magic square' which every row, column and diagonal sums up to a same number or two consecutive number. Another rule is that the sum of the 28 integer needs to be smaller than 1111.

It utilized concurrency module in python to speed up the calculation process. The difficult part for this problem is that there is too much possibilities to put in that 28 box. By setting boundries rule and restriction, it would then be easier to compute a solution within reasonable time.
